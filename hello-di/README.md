# spring-barebones

This is a bare bones Spring application built using spring-context ver. 4.3.9.RELEASE, Apache Maven 3.3.9 and JDK 1.8 to demonstrate Spring framework's powerful Dependency Injection feature. You can run the application from CLI using following java command:

java -jar Spring-Barebones-DI-App-jar-with-dependencies.jar

The example shows the basic concept of dependency injection, the MessagePrinter is decoupled from the MessageService implementation, with Spring Framework wiring everything together.
